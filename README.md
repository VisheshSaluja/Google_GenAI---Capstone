# 💰 Personal Finance Advisor with Gemini

This project was created as part of the **GenAI Intensive Capstone with Google and Kaggle**. It showcases how **Generative AI** can be used to intelligently analyze, summarize, and advise on personal financial data — starting with just a raw **bank statement PDF**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

🧾 **Document Understanding**  
Parse real bank statements (PDF) using PyMuPDF and extract structured transactions using Gemini.

🧠 **Generative AI Summaries**  
Generate monthly spending summaries, category breakdowns, and AI insights using few-shot prompting.

📊 **Smart Budget Planner**  
Generate controlled JSON budget plans via Gemini, visualize allocations, and identify top spending areas.

📈 **GenAI Evaluation**  
Score and evaluate financial health based on real vs. planned spending using structured Gemini prompts.

💬 **Conversational Finance Chatbot**  
Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and embeddings to ask personalized questions about your spending, like:
- "What was my biggest expense?"
- "Did I overspend on groceries?"
- "When did I spend the least?"
